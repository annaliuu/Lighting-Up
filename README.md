# Pre-work - *Lighting Up*

**Lighting Up** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Anna Liu**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tab), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used https://cssreference.io/ to experiment with different background colors. I also watched a few basic syntax tutorials of HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Youtube.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge that I encountered when creating this game was just getting used to the syntax. Because I have never used HTML, CSS, or Javascript before, even with a Python background, it was a little overwhelming in the beginning getting myself familiar with these languages. I found myself always expanding and reading the extra descriptions about the syntax and other fundamentals, which did frustrate me because I wanted to get on with developing the game and creating all these interesting features. However, I forced myself to slow down and continuously reminded myself that I needed to understand the basics first before delving deeper into web development. I made an active effort to take it one step at a time and fully understand the function of every piece of code and syntax choice present. Even after this, I still found myself copying and pasting occasionally without fully understanding how the chunk of code plays into the game. To further combat this, I sought out basic tutorials on Youtube just to get myself more familiar and comfortable with these languages, which tremendously furthered my understanding. After doing so, I found it easier to follow along and complete the pre-work, as I now had a better grasp of why I was implementing a certain feature and how it functions as a larger part of the overall game.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing the pre-work, I’m curious as to how web development integrates the use of APIs and pulls information from databases, if at all. From doing the pre-work, everything we needed for the game could be done simply using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was especially surprising to me because I always thought that even making a simple feature on a website was really complicated and required integration with a lot of backend work. Now, I’m even more curious to see how creative web development can get when more tools, languages, and databases are utilized in addition to just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition to that, I’m also curious as to how to deploy a web page, such as the game we created in the pre-work assignment, so that it can be published and made publicly available for use. I think that it’s so cool to be able to have the skills to build an entire web page out of scratch and make whatever it is that you want. Once I learn how to deploy a website, so many possibilities open up and I’m excited to be able to build things that can benefit the public good in the long run.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely try my hand at implementing some of the optional features. Having the button play time speed up as the game moves along, using a random secret pattern, giving the player 3 tries before losing, and incorporating a timer into the game all sound like cool ways to make the game more complex and enjoyable for the user.
